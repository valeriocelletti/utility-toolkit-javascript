# Build the toolkit #

To build the toolkit, some tools are required:

*     Java must be installed and possibly available in the path
*     Download compiler.jar from [https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)
*     Download js.jar from [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rhino/Download_Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rhino/Download_Rhino)
*     ~~Download r.js from [https://github.com/jrburke/r.j](https://github.com/jrburke/r.j)~~ A custom build of r.js is currently included. It was generated from [https://github.com/mone/r.js](https://github.com/mone/r.js)

Put the downloaded files in this folder, then run

Linux
```
java -cp compiler.jar:js.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main r.js -o app.build.js
```

Windows
```
java -cp compiler.jar;js.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main r.js -o app.build.js
```

Built files will be available in the built folder. Note that the utility-toolkit.js file
will contain all the modules.
